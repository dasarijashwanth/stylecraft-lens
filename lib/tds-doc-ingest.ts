// worst-case (a 45s first attempt + a 10s retry, see lib/openai.ts's
// createResponseWithRetry) — CONFIRMED LIVE, this happened repeatedly in
// production even after two earlier attempts to share one budget between
// content-extraction AND fact-extraction in a single request: OCR alone can
// already consume nearly the entire 60s window, so ANY further AI work
// (extractStructuredFacts's own up-to-30s call) stacked in the SAME request
// still risked the platform's hard kill — which returns a plain HTML error
// page instead of JSON, and the browser's `res.json()` then crashes with
// "Unexpected token '<', \"<!DOCTYPE \"... is not valid JSON" / "Server
// took too long to respond" instead of a legible error.
//
// The real fix is architectural, not a tighter shared clock: content
// extraction (ingestSourceDocUpload, this file) and fact extraction
// (deriveFactsForDoc, below) are now two SEPARATE requests, each with its
// own full deadline, so they never compound within one 60s window — the
// same "one phase per request" discipline this codebase already uses for
// the analysis and GTM generation pipelines (lib/analysisEngine.ts,
// lib/project-generation-engine.ts), applied here for the same reason.
//
// Reduced from 50s to 40s after a live report of the SAME "server took too
// long" timeout recurring for a large (10-15MB) text-layer PDF (not a
// scanned one — the OCR fallback never even triggers for these). withDeadline
// only reliably races away an async/network-bound call (like the OCR vision
// request) — it CANNOT interrupt genuinely synchronous CPU work, and
// pdf-parse's own page-by-page text extraction for a large, complex,
// many-page PDF can be CPU-heavy enough on Vercel's constrained runtime that
// there wasn't enough headroom left, after this budget, for the remaining
// DB writes (createNewVersion/updateExtractionResult/carry-forward) to
// finish before the platform's own 60s hard kill. 40s leaves a full 20s of

// retry) — worst case ~42s for a SINGLE extractStructuredFacts call whose
// first attempt genuinely times out. A 40s budget here meant withDeadline
// almost always won that race and returned the failure fallback BEFORE the
// retry ever got a chance to succeed — guaranteeing a false "extraction had
// an error" for any document whose first attempt ran long, not an
// occasional edge case. The facts route's own maxDuration is 60s (it does
